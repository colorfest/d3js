# Accio Code Tutorials: D3js#

*** Updated 7-27-16 ***

This tutorial series for [Accio Code](http://www.youtube.com/user/CDPAdvertising "Accio Code on YouTube") is a beginner's course in D3.js, a JavaScript library for displaying data dynamically on a website.

In this course we will be installing and running d3.js and learn the basics of how to use data to create charts, graphs, shapes, objects and a few useful lessons on making your own d3.js projects.

## What is D3js ##
D3.js (Data Driven Documents) is not a programming language. It is a JavaScript based library used for creating dynamic data displays.
D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.
